![Neural Network](http://sy0316.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/img/Neural_Networks_Structure.png)

This repository contains a neural network regression model implemented from scratch. The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the operational logic behind neural networks.

## Features

- Implementation of a feed forward neural network architecture.
- Configurable number of layers and neurons per layer.
- Support for various activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).
- Flexible training options, including customizable learning rate and batch size.
- Efficient back propagation algorithm for weight updates.
- Evaluation of model performance with regression metrics.
- Save and load trained models for future use.
